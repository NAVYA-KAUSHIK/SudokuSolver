SUDOKU SOLVER 
__________________________________________________________ 

DESCRIPTION : 
___________________________________________________________________ 

Welcome to my Project! This is a SUDOKU SOLVER made in C++ .  

For a test case given in the program itself, the code uses backtracking algorithm to solve the given 9x9 sudoku.
The idea was to check the  number was not already present in the same   row, column and 3x3 subgrid.
After  checking the code for possible numbers and places  , the program recursively checks whether the assignment of number leads to solution or not.

 There  is a partially filled 9x9 grid(sudoku),  

We have to place numbers from 1 to 9 in the empty places ( denoted by 0's) such that every number only appears once  in each row, column  and 3x3 subgrid;
